        Almost every region in the Philippines have their own pork adobo
        version. Sometimes, there can be more than one version in a location.
        This is one of the favorite when it comes to family picnics. This is a
        dish wherein pork and chicken slices are combined and cooked inadobo
        style. It can be done the same way as this recipe, with or without
        onions.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 lbs pork belly</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons garlic minced or crushed</li>
          <li>5 dried bay leaves</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons vinegar</li>
          <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon peppercorn</li>
          <li>2 cups water</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and
            crushed garlic. It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is
            limited, one hour should be enough. Some like to add vinegar during
            the process. You may do so if preferred.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to
            be browned
          </li>
          <li>Heat a cooking pot.</li>
          <li>Add pork with garlic.</li>
          <li>You can also add a few tablespoons of cooking oil.</li>
          <li>Cook the pork until it turns brown and tender.</li>
          <li>
            Do this by pouring the remaining marinade, if any. Also add water.
            Let the liquid boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is the part where I put the whole peppercorn and dried bay
            leaves. These ingredients complete my pork adobo.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boiling for 40 minutes should be enough to tenderize the pork. There
            are times when you have to cook longer.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>
          If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it
          into the pot and let it cook for 10 minutes. Salt is an optional
          ingredient for this recipe. Use it only if you think it is needed.
